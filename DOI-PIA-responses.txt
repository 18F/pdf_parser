APPENDIX A: DI-4001 PIA FORM / 1Privacy Impact Assessment(System name) Version Number: [x.x]Version Date: Issued by: [Senior Official for Privacy (if designated, otherwise the privacy point of contact)]IntroductionThe Department of the Interior requires a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) to be conducted and maintained on all IT systems whether already in existence, in development or undergoing modification in order to adequately evaluate privacy risks, ensure the protection of privacy information, and consider privacy implications throughout the information system development life cycle.Need more guidance? The DOI PIA Guide provides more in-depth information on when and why PIAs are required, legal references and guidelines for filling out this template. You can also email the Departmental Privacy Office for more help.I.

For General Support Systems (GSS) be sure to include all hosted major applications, minor applications, or other subsystems, and describe the purposes and types of PII if any. Privacy risks must be identified and adequately addressed for each hosted application or subsystem identified in the GSS PIA. It is strongly recommended that a separate PIA be conducted specifically for each hosted application or subsystem that contains significant amounts of PII. In any case, the GSS PIA must identify all hosted applications, describe the relationship, and reference or append the PIAs conducted for the hosted applications. The GSS PIA and associated PIAs must be reviewed and approved by all officials as appropriate; and all related PIAs, SORNs and supporting artifacts must be entered into CSAM.SUBSYSTEM NAME PURPOSE CONTAINS PII?
